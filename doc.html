            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                The challenges of this project was to properly format and display the quiz questions with their answers in a random
                order. The code would print out the correct answer first and then the following 3 after always so I had to randomize
                the answers in an array. Which isn't challenging in restrospect but definitely was not friendly for javascript.
                The array wouldn't properly add the answers at one point and would combine multiple words into one. <br><br>
                Another challenge was tracking the score that the user got from their final sum of answers. Javascript does not
                seem to play as nicely with variables and constants inside and outside of functions so I was not able to properly keep
                track after hours and hours of different loops, dispay methods and functions.<br><br> 
                Also managing to implement javascript and specific CSS on radio buttons was difficult even with the templates online.

            <h3>Final Grade Self Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                For a final grade, I would give myself a 75. I definitely failed in some aspects of getting the basic 
                concept of my site to work. Unfortunately I couldn't figure any way around it after many hours of trying 
                new methods. I think my CSS is Okay. It isn't terribly ufly but it also isnt nearly as nice as I would have 
                hoped. A big issue was the radio and input buttons and how I could not get them to look and function the way I 
                had intended. I also intended to add a timer but did not find the time since I was focused on the main functionality
                first.
